## Troubleshooting <a name="troubleshooting"></a>
If you encounter issues while setting up or running the project, here are some common solutions:

### Docker Issues
* Docker not found: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. Refer to the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for assistance.
* Port conflicts: Check if the ports used by the application (3000, 5050, 8080) are free. If not, modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to use different ports.
### Backend Issues
* JAVA_HOME not set: Ensure the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set correctly. You can set it by adding the following to your system's environment variables:
```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/jdk
```
* Maven build issues: Ensure Maven is installed and properly configured. Run `mvn -v` to check your Maven installation.
### Frontend Issues
* Node.js not found: Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine. Refer to the Node.js installation guide for assistance.
* Dependency issues: If `npm install` fails, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.
